# 👋 Hi, I’m Brenda!

## 🧠 Project Manager | 📚 Bookworm | ✍️ Technical & Creative Writer  

### 🛠 What I do:
- 🧩 **Project Manager** by day — Controller of Chaos™ with 8+ years wrangling timelines, stakeholders, and systems into submission
- 🔍 **Problem-solver** who thrives in fast-paced environments and gets things done with a smile (and a spreadsheet)
- 🛠 Skilled in Agile, ClickUp, Jira, Monday, and the occasional interpretive dance of communication (but only in the Old Navy dressing room)

### 📚 What I love:
- Books, books, books — from business strategy to fantasy and YA 
- Pop culture deep dives (yes, I *do* have thoughts on which American Girl doll you're most like)
- Media binging at Olympic levels — if it's got a plot, I'm already watching, reading, or analyzing it

### 💬 Let’s talk:
- Want to know how I turned chaos into calm for a software team?
- Need a reading rec for your next beach trip *or* team meeting?
- Just want to nerd out about Taylor Swift, The Babysitters Club, or whatever you're currently obsessed with?

I'm your gal. 🤓
